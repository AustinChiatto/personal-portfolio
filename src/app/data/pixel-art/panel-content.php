        <p class="a-text--copy">In this project, I took on the dual role of UI/UX designer and Front-End Developer as a way to improve both skill sets.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">UI & UX</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I wanted to ensure the users pixel art was the star of the show. For this reason I used a dark color pallet and kept the interface as minimalistic as possible. I chose the latter for two reasons:</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">Firstly, I wanted the user to have as few barriers to creation as possible. The color selection is based on a sunset and is a simple set of colors to ensure all of the users art matches the rest of the collage, and to promote creativity by limiting the amount of colors.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">Second, as mentioned before I wanted to make the art the star of the show. To do this, both the pixel art creator and the collage view have as little other content as possible.</p>

        <p class="a-text--copy">This full stack application was built using a MERN stack. MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS. This stack has great documentation and extensive resources for me to take advantage of. I had no prior experience with the first half of the MERN stack which was a fun challenge, and this creative project was a great way for me to learn those technologies.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Purpose</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with the MERN stack technologies. I was previously familiar with ReactJS and NodeJS but MongoDB and ExpressJS were new territories.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">In addition to learning these technologies I wanted to build an application that allowed my BCIT cohort to contribute to as a sort of “class portrait”. I thought this would be a fun way to do so by having each member contribute a piece of art to a larger collage.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">MERN Stack</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">The previous projects on my portfolio did not make use of a backend. For that reason I knew it was one of the weaker points in my skill set. To fix that I chose to create this project with MongoDB as the backend.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I found Mongo to be relatively simple to set up, however, configuring the connection with ExpressJS proved to be quite the challenge.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Technology</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">The primary objective of this project was to enhance my knowledge and proficiency in using ReactJS by carefully considering its design and implementation.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">ReactJS</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">React allowed me to take advantage of components, states, hooks, and other valuable features to create this application as an single page application, which is something I did not have the chance to do until now.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">React Router</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">React Router allowed me to change pages within this SPA. It also allowed me to pass the user param from the login page using the useParam Hook.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">MongoDB</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">Allowed me to store users and the art created by the users within the application.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">ExpressJS</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">Helped with connecting the application to MongoDB, user authentication, and pulling the correct data for the live collage.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">CSS</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I wanted to use vanilla CSS for this project because Sass nesting is now available within CSS. Currently the browser compatibility is not 100% accepted so I did have to create fall backs incase the user was interacting with this application on an older browser.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">GitHub</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I chose to use GitHub as my version control system because it&apos;s something I am familiar with and provides easy functionality across multiple applications.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Figma</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">For the design of the project I used Figma. I think it pairs well with a framework like React as building components while designing sets the stage for how the structure of the code will be handled.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">With the inclusion of the new "dev" mode inside of Figma, this process is even easier with the information now available in a VS Code extension.</p>
