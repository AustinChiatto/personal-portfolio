        <p class="a-text--copy">Given that this project served as a tool for myself and others, I saw an opportunity to enhance and unify other tools I previously developed, such as the <a class="a-link-primary" href="https://austinchiatto.com/grid-tool.php" title="View Project" target="_blank">Grid Tool</a> and Snippet Editor. This allowed me to leverage the UI components I already created, resulting in a more cohesive and streamlined user experience.</p>

        <p class="a-text--copy">The Code To Image tool is the second tool I built for this project, following the <a class="a-link-primary" href="https://austinchiatto.com/grid-tool.php" title="View Project" target="_blank">Grid Tool</a>. To maintain consistency and efficiency, I utilized the React components that I developed earlier. As a result, Code To Image was developed using ReactJS and SCSS, ensuring a robust and dynamic application.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Simplicity</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">During my time at BCIT, I found myself frequently experimenting with code snippets, using tools like Figma, in an attempt to enhance the appearance and professionalism of my code. I wanted to avoid sharing or presenting unattractive screenshots of my code outside of the editor. Motivated by this, I developed a tool to transform mundane code snippet screenshots into visually appealing representations.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">ReactJS Growth</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I saw this project as an invaluable opportunity to expand my knowledge of React. It served as a platform to solidify my understanding of the fundamentals while simultaneously acquiring new skills and tools, such as <a class="a-link-primary" href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main" title="View Resource" target="_blank">React Router</a>, <a class="a-link-primary" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image" title="View Resource" target="_blank">html-to-img</a>, <a class="a-link-primary" href="https://highlightjs.org/" title="View Resource" target="_blank">HighlightJS</a>, and various others.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Technology</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">The primary objective of this project was to enhance my knowledge and proficiency in using ReactJS by carefully considering its design and implementation.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">React Router</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I incorporated the same UI components from my previous React project, the "<a class="a-link-primary" href="https://austinchiatto.com/grid-tool.php" title="View Project" target="_blank">Grid Tool</a>", into this project. This inspired me to develop a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) that would showcase the various tools and snippets I created during my schooling.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">To develop the single page application, I utilized React Router for efficient page transitions. I was pleasantly surprised by how straightforward it was to implement, thanks to the comprehensive and easy-to-follow documentation provided.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">In Addition, I constructed an intuitive landing page featuring conveniently displayed thumbnails for each tool, offering users a seamless and efficient navigation experience.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">HTML-To-Image</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">To ensure the successful functionality of this project, I devised a solution that would allow the user to download a React component as an image. I accomplished this by leveraging a library called <a class="a-link-primary" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image" title="View Resource" target="_blank">html-to-img</a>, that provides a function to convert a DOM node into an image format using HTML canvas.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">useRef()</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">To convert a React component into an image using html-to-img, I utilized the useRef React Hook. This handy Hook enabled me to easily reference and store the desired component, which I could then pass to the html-to-img function. By passing this function as a prop to the export button, I was able to generate a downloadable image of the component effortlessly.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">JSON</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I implemented the use of JSON objects to store the style data for each of the user&apos;s customization options. This approach has multiple advantages. First, it helps maintain the readability of my code by keeping the style data separate and organized. Second, it enables me to easily extract only the necessary information for each user.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Sass</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I chose to incorporate SCSS for the styling of this project to leverage module styling, global mixins, nesting, functions, and other valuable features throughout the entire site as required.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">GitHub</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I chose to use GitHub as my version control system because it&apos;s something I am familiar with and provides easy functionality across multiple applications.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Figma</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">For the design of the project I used Figma. I think it pairs well with a framework like React as building components while designing sets the stage for how the structure of the code will be handled.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">With the inclusion of the new "dev" mode inside of Figma, this process is even easier with the information now available in a VS Code extension.</p>
