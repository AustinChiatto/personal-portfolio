        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">UI & UX</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">In designing the user interface, I aimed to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. Taking inspiration from Apple&apos;s design principles, I incorporated clean and minimalist elements to ensure that the interface remained intuitive for users.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I also used this part of the project to create a consistent design language, and set of components, that I could employ in future projects. This not only improved efficiency but also helped in establishing a recognizable brand identity across different interfaces.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Developer</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">By leveraging React, I was able to break down the project into modular components, making the development process more efficient and maintainable. The use of components allowed for reusability and facilitated the organization and management of the codebase.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">This is what will open the door to building more tools like the Grid Tool in the future, allowing me to utilize the design language and components across the entire set of applications.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Helping New Developers</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">During my time at BCIT in the New Media & Web Development program, many of my cohort struggled to grasp some of the basics of coding, at the time I didn&apos;t have a way to help them overcome these struggles.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I designed this project in order to help with those challenges faced by my friends and for other new developers that would benefit to a layout tool to make things easier or quicker during the development process.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Skill Improvement</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">Other than my mission to help new developers learn and interact with CSS grid layouts, my main focus behind this project was to further my skills as a front-end developer. This project was my first time using ReactJS, and it was incredibly fun and equally challenging.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">If you want to learn even more about my experience with React you can find a complete breakdown in the GitHub Repo.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Learning ReactJS</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">To be completely honest, I have had a hell of a time trying to learn React for this project... Taking a step back I think that was because of a few core reasons.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">React and ES6 are soul mates, and at the time I began learning React I had twice as much confidence in my ES6 knowledge than I had actual knowledge...</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">The first time I saw some react code it was so much different to what I was expecting a JS framework to be it took me off guard. Arrows everywhere! It honestly looked more like hieroglyphics than JavaScript at first glance.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Component & Prop Relationships</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">The other struggle I had when learning React was how components interacted with each other... I found it hard to grasp at first, especially with the inclusion of state, where does state go, how do I pass values from one component to another efficiently, etc.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">Fortunately React has very detailed documentation & tutorials I could use, and gaining a more in depth knowledge of hooks in general made this part of the learning process much easier to understand.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Technology</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">As this project was a way for me to learn and increase my skills with React I chose to focus primarily on that framework. However, I pair that with sass and a few plugins such as React D&D (drag & drop) to allow for a more rapid development process.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">ReactJS</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I chose to use ReactJS for this project as it was a chance for me to learn the framework outside of my schooling. It also allowed me to take advantage of components, states, hooks, and other valuable features to create this application as an SPA, which is something I did not have the chance to do until now.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">React D&D</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">Drag and drop functionality for the grid child elements is not something I had the time to build from scratch, this is why I chose to use a 3rd party option by including <a class="a-link-primary" href="https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about" title="See React DnD Library" target="_blank">React DnD</a> to my project.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">This made creating the feature much easier, and a lot less time consuming to build. A from scratch drag and drop functionality may be something I look at building in the future, but for now this fits my use case perfectly.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Sass</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I decided to include sass for the styling of this project in order to take advantage of module styling as well as global mixins, nesting, functions, and other useful content across the site where needed.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">GitHub</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I chose to use GitHub as my version control system as it is something I am familiar with using and provides easy functionality across multiple of my applications. The added bonus of having VS Code extensions for managing repo&apos;s makes the use of GitHub as my version control a no brainer!</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Figma</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">For the design of the project I used Figma, I think it pairs really well with a framework like React as building out the components while designing sets the stage for how the structure of the code will be handled</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">With the inclusion of the new "dev" mode inside Figma, this process is even easier as it now provides a lot of the information needed for each component write in VS Code with the added extension.</p>
