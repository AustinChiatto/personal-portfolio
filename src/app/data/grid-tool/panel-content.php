        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">UI & UX</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">Drawing inspiration from Apple, I sought to design a UI that would be intuitive and friendly for a user. I also wanted to be able to put together a design language that could be used throughout future projects.</p>

        <p class="a-text--copy">The main focus behind this project was to further my skills as a front-end developer. This project was my first time using ReactJS, and it was incredibly fun and equally challenging.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">If you want to learn even more about my experience with React you can find a complete breakdown in the GitHub Repo.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">ReactJS</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">To be completely honest, I have had a hell of a time trying to learn React for this project... Taking a step back I think that was because of a few core reasons.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">ES6 Knowledge</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">React and ES6 are soul mates, and at the time I began learning React I had twice as much confidence in my ES6 knowledge than I had actual knowledge...</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">The first time I saw some react code it was so much different to what I was expecting a JS framework to be it took me off guard. Arrows everywhere! It honestly looked more like hieroglyphics than JavaScript at first glance.</p>
