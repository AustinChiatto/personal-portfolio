        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">UI & UX</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">In designing the user interface, I aimed to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. Taking inspiration from Apple&apos;s design principles, I incorporated clean and minimalist elements to ensure that the interface remained intuitive for users.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I also used this part of the project to create a consistent design language and set of components that I could employ in future projects. This improved efficiency and helped in establishing a recognizable brand identity across different interfaces.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Developer</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">By leveraging React, I was able to break down the project into modular components, making the development process more efficient and maintainable. The use of components allowed for reusability and facilitated the organization and management of the codebase.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">This is what will open the door to building more tools like the Grid Tool in the future, allowing me to utilize the design language and components across the entire set of applications.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Helping New Developers</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">While at BCIT in the New Media & Web Development program, many in my cohort struggled to grasp the basics of coding. At the time, I didn&apos;t have a way to help them overcome this struggle.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I designed this project to help with the challenges faced by my friends and for new developers, who would benefit with a layout tool.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Skill Improvement</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">Other than my mission to help new developers learn and interact with CSS grid layouts, my main focus behind this project was to further my skills as a front-end developer. This project was my first time using ReactJS, and it was incredibly fun and equally challenging.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Learning ReactJS</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I had a difficult time learning React because React and ES6 are soul mates. When I began learning React I had twice as much confidence in my ES6 knowledge than I had actual knowledge. I felt like I was thrown into the deep end.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Component & Prop Relationships</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">The most difficult concept for me to learn in React was how components interacted with each other. I found it hard to grasp at first, especially with the inclusion of state, where does state go? How do I pass values from one component to another?</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">Fortunately, React has detailed documentation that I used to and gain an in depth knowledge of hooks. This made the learning process easier and answered my questions.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Technology</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">As this project was a way for me to learn and increase my skills with React, I chose to focus primarily on that framework. However, I paired that with sass and a few plugins such as React D&D (drag & drop) to allow for a more rapid development process.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">ReactJS</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">React allowed me to take advantage of components, states, hooks, and other valuable features to create this application as an single page application, which is something I did not have the chance to do until now.</p>

    <article class="m-content-panel__section">
        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Sass</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">I decided to include sass for the styling of this project to take advantage of module styling, as well as global mixins, functions, and other useful content across the site where needed.</p>

        <h4 class="m-content-panel__copy-heading">Figma</h4>
        <p class="a-text--copy">For the design of the project I used Figma. I think it pairs well with a framework like React as building components while designing sets the stage for how the structure of the code will be handled.</p>
        <p class="a-text--copy">With the inclusion of the new "dev" mode inside of Figma, this process is even easier with the information now available in a VS Code extension.</p>
